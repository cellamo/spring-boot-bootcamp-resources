## Documentation for the given code block

### Package and Imports
```java
package com.ltp.workbook;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;
```
This code block is part of the `com.ltp.workbook` package and imports necessary classes and annotations for Spring MVC.

### Class and Annotations
```java
@Controller
public class WorkbookController {
    // ...
}
```
This class `WorkbookController` is marked with the `@Controller` annotation, indicating that it serves as a controller for handling HTTP requests.

### Method `getShows`
```java
@GetMapping("/")
public ModelAndView getShows(Model model) {
    Map<String, Show> showsMap = new HashMap<>();
    showsMap.put("first", new Show("Breaking Bad", "Ozymandias", 10.0));
    showsMap.put("second", new Show("Attack on Titan", "Hero", 9.9));
    showsMap.put("third", new Show("Attack on Titan", "Perfect Game", 9.9));
    showsMap.put("fourth", new Show("Star Wars: The Clone Wars", "Victory and Death", 9.9));
    showsMap.put("fifth", new Show("Mr. Robot", "407 Proxy Authentication Required", 9.9));

    model.addAllAttributes(showsMap);

    return new ModelAndView("shows", showsMap);
}
```
- This method is annotated with `@GetMapping("/")`, indicating that it handles HTTP GET requests for the root path ("/").
- It takes a `Model` object as a parameter, which can be used to pass data to the view.
- It creates a `showsMap` object of type `Map<String, Show>` to hold the show data.
- Show objects are added to the map using unique keys ("first", "second", etc.).
- The show data is added to the `Model` using `model.addAllAttributes(showsMap)`.
- Finally, it returns a `ModelAndView` object, specifying the view name ("shows") and passing the `showsMap` as the model.

### Method `getShows2`
```java
@GetMapping("/shows")
public String getShows2(Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("first", new Show("Breaking Bad", "Ozymandias", 10.0));
    model.addAttribute("second", new Show("Attack on Titan", "Hero", 9.9));
    model.addAttribute("third", new Show("Attack on Titan", "Perfect Game", 9.9));
    model.addAttribute("fourth", new Show("Star Wars: The Clone Wars", "Victory and Death", 9.9));
    model.addAttribute("fifth", new Show("Mr. Robot", "407 Proxy Authentication Required", 9.9));

    return "shows2";
}
```
- This method is annotated with `@GetMapping("/shows")`, indicating that it handles HTTP GET requests for the "/shows" path.
- It takes a `Model` object as a parameter, which can be used to pass data to the view.
- Show objects are added to the model using unique attributes ("first", "second", etc.).
- Finally, it returns the view name as a string ("shows2").

### Show Class
The `Show` class is not provided in the code block, but it is referenced as the type for the show objects. It likely contains properties for the show's title, episode, and rating.

Note: This documentation assumes that the code provided in the question is part of a larger Spring MVC application, where the views ("shows" and "shows2") are rendered using a template engine like Thymeleaf or JSP.

### Summary
The `WorkbookController` class serves as a controller for handling HTTP requests related to shows. It provides two methods, `getShows` and `getShows2`, which handle GET requests for different paths.

The `getShows` method uses the `ModelAndView` approach to populate the model with show data. It creates a `showsMap` object, adds `Show` objects to it, and then adds the entire map to the `Model` using `model.addAllAttributes(showsMap)`. It returns a `ModelAndView` object specifying the view name as "shows" and passing the `showsMap` as the model.

The `getShows2` method uses the `Model` approach to populate the model with show data. It adds individual `Show` objects to the `Model` using unique attributes ("first", "second", etc.). It returns the view name as a string ("shows2").

The code suggests that there are two views/templates, "shows" and "shows2", where the show data will be rendered using a template engine like Thymeleaf or JSP.

Please note that the provided documentation assumes the presence of additional code and dependencies, such as the `Show` class and the necessary configuration for the Spring MVC application.
